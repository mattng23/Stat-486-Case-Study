# Chicago Crime Analysis: Weather, Holidays, and Lunar Cycles

## Overview

This project aims to investigate the influence of weather, major holidays, and lunar cycles on the rate of violent crimes in the city of Chicago, IL. By analyzing Chicago crime data alongside weather data, lunar cycle information, and holiday dates, we sought to develop a machine learning model to understand the relationships between these factors and crime rates. The ultimate goal is to provide insights to the Chicago Police Department to enhance crime prevention and response strategies.

## Data Sources

- **Crimes.csv**: Contains Chicago crime data, including types of crimes, locations, and timestamps.
- **Weather.csv**: Provides weather data for Chicago, including temperature, precipitation, and other relevant metrics.
- **Full_moon.csv**: Lists dates of full moon occurrences, which may have potential correlations with human behavior.
- **Holidays.csv**: Includes major holiday dates, which could impact crime rates due to changes in social dynamics and police presence.
